*How can we harness the advantages of automated decision-making systems to build a more just and equitable future, respecting each individual, as well as our environment?* I am pursuing an answer to this question via my interdisciplinary research that is firmly grounded in the hard sciences.

My current focus is on developing and improving explanation techniques for machine learning models. For more information, check my [Publications](https://lstate.github.io/publications/).

I am a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early Stage Researcher with the
[NoBIAS ITN](https://nobias-project.eu)
and a PhD student in
[Data Science](https://datasciencephd.eu/).
While I am based in the
[KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/) 
at the University of Pisa, my PhD is hosted by the [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/eng).
My PhD supervisors are Salvatore Ruggieri and Franco Turini.
