<div class="title">
Laura State
</div>

Hi! Thanks for visiting my website.

I am Laura State, currently a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Early Stage Researcher with the
[NoBIAS ITN](https://nobias-project.eu)
and a PhD student in
[Data Science](https://datasciencephd.eu/).
While I am based in the
[KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/) 
at the University of Pisa, my PhD is hosted by the [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/eng).
My PhD supervisors are Salvatore Ruggieri and Franco Turini.

I want to contribute to a better understanding of machine learning models. Specifically, I am interested in the social implications of those systems, and long-term consequences. I am currently focusing on developing and improving explanation techniques for machine learning models that are not interpretable, with a focus on constrastive explanations. To this end, I am heavily drawing from formal logic.

I hold a B.Sc. in Physics and a M.Sc. in Neural Information Processing.
Further, I have done two internships in the micro-finance industry, working on data analytics.

I am also interested in feminist theory, and making scientific research accessible for a broader public.
