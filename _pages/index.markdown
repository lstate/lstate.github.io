I am Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Impact AI](https://www.hiig.de/en/project/impact-ai/) project at the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society in Berlin. 

Previously, I was both a PhD student in Data Science and an Early Stage Researcher in the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie ITN [NoBIAS](https://nobias-project.eu). I obtained my PhD degree from the [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/en), Pisa. My PhD advisors were Salvatore Ruggieri and Franco Turini.

I study the implications of AI on society and the planet, and develop methods to assess these implications. The overall aim is to better understand how AI can be used to build a more sustainable future. My research has a strong interdisciplinary character, drawing on my education in the hard sciences and experience both in academia and industry.
