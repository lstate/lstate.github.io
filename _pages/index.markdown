Laura State

I am Research Associate at the [KDD Lab](https://kdd.isti.cnr.it/) at the University of Pisa. 

Previously, I was both a PhD student in Data Science and an Early Stage Researcher in the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie ITN [NoBIAS](https://nobias-project.eu). I obtained my PhD degree from the [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/en), Pisa. My PhD advisors were Salvatore Ruggieri and Franco Turini.

I study issues of transparency and accountability of artificial intelligence (AI), with a focus on understanding non-interpretable machine learning models, assessing their societal impact, and building more responsible AI. While firmly grounded in the hard sciences, I follow an interdisciplinary approach with a focus on computer science and law and building on my academic and industry experience.
